# R's standard test. Its V is the sum of ranks for positive differences. R 4.6.0
# or later gives exact results that allow for the zero and the ties, but it ranks
# the zero with the other differences before setting it aside (the method of
# Pratt, 1959): V = 48.5 and two sided P = 0.458. StatsDirect, like Conover, sets
# zeros aside before ranking: the sum is 41.5 and two sided P = 0.4756. Each P is
# exact for its own method. Older versions of R warn and use a normal
# approximation with continuity correction, as exact = FALSE does (V = 41.5,
# two sided P = 0.4765).

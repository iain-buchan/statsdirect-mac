# Reports

In **Edit report**, resize a chart by dragging its green bottom-right corner or entering a **Width** in pixels. **Fit** restores the full report width. Proportions stay fixed, SVG charts stay vector based, and Undo/Redo includes size changes (Escape cancels a drag). A focused corner also accepts arrow keys, with Shift for larger steps. Imported charts and pictures use the same controls. Sizes remain in saved HTML, PDF and DOCX and when copying into Office; charts shrink to fit a narrower page or window.

Choose **Edit report** to change text and table cells, choose a font and exact point size, apply bold/italic/underline/strikethrough or superscript/subscript, set text colour and highlighting, use headings and nested bullet/numbered lists, indent and align paragraphs, and change line spacing. Common controls share one compact toolbar row; **More ⋯** opens the remaining controls without moving the report. All controls also remain in the **Format** menu. **Clear formatting** removes character styles from selected text. **Add text** inserts an interpretation section. Undo/redo works from the toolbar or ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z. Edits remain when more analyses are added. These are report edits: they do not recalculate results or change the original data or generated R script. Charts and help/R controls are protected from text formatting; use **Remove plot/result** and **Undo removal** for those actions. Cut, copy and paste preserve formatting, tables and charts within reports.

**Cut, paste and move:** highlight report content and use ⌘X/⌘C/⌘V, the Edit menu or the context menu. Drag highlighted content to the visible insertion caret to move it within a report; hold Option to copy instead. Click a chart to select it, then copy, cut or drag it. Moves between result sections undo in one step. Cutting a partial table selection clears only its selected cell content, preserving unselected cells and merged headings. Rich HTML/RTF from other applications retains supported formatting; external images and active content are omitted. Copying to Office still provides compatible tables and chart pictures.

Use **File → Open** for an old `.rtf` report. Text, tables and common formatting are converted to HTML; embedded WMF and EMF charts become SVG, and PNG/JPEG images are retained. The original RTF is never overwritten, and there is no RTF export. Save the converted copy in one of the formats below. Saved HTML reports can be reopened and edited too.

Imported RTF uses the viewer's readable body and table text sizes, consistent numeric alignment and paragraph spacing. Physical RTF cell boundaries restore spanning table headings so long headings do not stretch a single data column. Calibri, emphasis, colours and relative text sizes are retained. Reopening older HTML imports also repairs their legacy report sections while leaving accompanying Mac-generated results and notes intact. Once normalized, subsequent font and layout edits are retained when saving and reopening.

Legacy conversion preserves report content rather than the exact Windows page layout. Fonts, complex drawing effects, headers/footers, floating objects and advanced Word layout may differ. Windows chart fonts retain their original face first and use a fallback from the same family when unavailable: for example, Calibri → Carlito → Arial → Helvetica → sans-serif. Fonts installed privately inside Office may not be available to WebKit. No proprietary font files are bundled. Unsupported pictures have a visible placeholder and import note; embedded OLE objects are omitted. External images and active content are not loaded. Imports are limited to 30 MB and 200 pictures. Tests cover original synthetic WMF/EMF fixtures and one real Windows report containing three tables and four EMF charts; a wider archive is still needed to assess broader fidelity.

With a report tab selected, use **File → Save Report…** (⌘S) and choose HTML, PDF or Word (.docx). File → Export also offers each format directly. The complete active report is saved, including results appended by earlier analyses.

- **HTML:** a standalone report with inline styles and charts. Bundled help links become links to the public StatsDirect help site. App-only actions and scripts are removed.
- **PDF:** paginated A4 output using the native WebKit print pipeline, retaining vector charts. Long tables continue across pages; WebKit does not repeat their headings reliably.
- **DOCX:** editable text and tables, fonts and point sizes, colours/highlighting, line spacing, paragraph indentation and real nested lists, merged cells, repeated table headings, hyperlinks, superscripts/subscripts, and SVG charts with PNG fallbacks. Word layout differs from the on-screen report. Closed input-details sections are excluded from PDF/DOCX.

Select report content and **Copy** (⌘C), then paste into Excel. Tables remain cells, numbers remain numeric, and merged headings are retained. Scientific notation is preserved; labels and long numeric identifiers are text. Charts paste as pictures. A tab-separated fallback serves plain-text destinations. Excel retains destination column widths: use its AutoFit Column Width command if long labels need more room. Verification used Microsoft Excel for Mac with normal ⌘V.

## Development

The prebuilt browser bundle and dependency licences are included in `Content/Report`; normal app builds need no JavaScript package installation. Rebuild after changing report JavaScript:

```sh
pnpm --dir Report install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir Report build
node --test Report/clipboard.test.mjs
Scripts/test-report-export.sh
```

The native test covers RTF tables, Unicode, hidden fields, hex/binary WMF/EMF pictures, corrupt input, offline sanitization, report editing/undo/reopen and export. It also runs the real paired-t/agreement and chi-square engines, exports a combined report with a 65-row table and merged headings, checks PDF pagination, reopens HTML for DOCX export, and checks full/partial/empty clipboard selections. Transfer tests use a private test pasteboard and cover styled cut/paste, merged/partial tables, lists, SVG definitions and size, drag/Option-drag, atomic undo across sections, stale selections, external HTML/RTF sanitization and saving/reopening moved content. It uses an isolated app, leaves the user's workspace intact, and writes artifacts under `.build/report-export-output`. Add `"$PWD/StatsDirect.app" --stay-open` for native Office and save-dialog checks.

RTF text and tables use AppKit; an isolated, network-blocked WebView uses DOMPurify and emf-converter for import. Only sanitized HTML reaches the report editor. Report export runs in an isolated WebKit JavaScript world. Saving is atomic; unreadable images/styles and oversized reports produce an error rather than an incomplete export. Current bounds are 30 MB source HTML, 200 images, and 80 MB base64 DOCX. Very wide tables may need page/column adjustments in Word or a smaller report.

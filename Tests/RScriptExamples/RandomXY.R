# Randomizing a series of integers: the StatsDirect help illustration (the numbers
# 1 to 49, as in a lottery, put in a random order with seed 10) in R
x <- 1

# sample(x:y) returns the integers x to y in a random order, every order being
# equally likely. StatsDirect and R each have their own Mersenne Twister generator
# and their own way of turning its output into a random order, so the same seed
# gives a different series in R: the two columns of the output are the same, the
# numbers are not. Keep the seed with the series, as either program can then repeat it.
# (For a series of one number, x = y, sample(x:y) would instead shuffle 1 to x.)

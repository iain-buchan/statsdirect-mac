# Random numbers by distribution: the StatsDirect help illustration (ten standard
# normal deviates from seed 1234, then samples from the other distributions that the
# Data_Generating_Random Numbers menu offers) in R

# its own way, so the same seed gives a different series in each program. Within one
# program a seed always repeats its own series: set.seed() then the r* function.

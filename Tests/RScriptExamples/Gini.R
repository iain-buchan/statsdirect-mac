# re-samples as in the example (StatsDirect's default is 100,000). The limits
# depend on the random re-samples, so they differ a little from run to run and
# from StatsDirect's. R's bias is the mean re-sampled coefficient less G, the
# opposite way round to StatsDirect's. The BCa interval is given the jackknife
# influence values, so its acceleration is the one StatsDirect uses (Efron and
# Tibshirani 1993). With so few values R warns that the BCa limits are unstable.

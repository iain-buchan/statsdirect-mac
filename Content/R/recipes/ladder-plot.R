# StatsDirect recipe: Ladder, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (graphics/ladder.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# data: before, after

# Ladder plot: the StatsDirect help illustration (peak expiratory flow rate before
# and after a walk on a cold day in 9 asthmatics, the paired t test example; the test
# workbook's Parametric worksheet columns PEFR Before and PEFR After) in R

# StatsDirect puts the first column a quarter of the way along the x axis and the
# second three quarters of the way, a circle for each "before" value and a square for
# each "after" value, and joins each pair with a black line, the rung of the ladder.
# A pair with a blank in either column is left out. The axes are not boxed and the y
# axis has no title.

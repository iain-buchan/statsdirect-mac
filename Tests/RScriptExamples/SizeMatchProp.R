# Base R's power.prop.test() is for two independent groups and takes no account of the
# pairing, so the topic's formula (Dupont 1990, from Breslow and Day 1980) is used: the
# probabilities of the two kinds of discordant pair, the proportion of discordant pairs
# in which the experimental subject is the one who fails, then the number of pairs,
# rounded up. It needs p1 to differ from p0 and both discordant probabilities to be
# positive (r not too large), which is why StatsDirect refuses some inputs.

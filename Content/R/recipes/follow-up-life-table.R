# StatsDirect recipe: Follow-up life table, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (survival_analysis/follow_up_life_table.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# data: year = times, died = deaths, withdrawn = withdrawals
# settings: alive_at_start = natst, confidence = gamma

# Follow-up (actuarial) life table: the StatsDirect help example (Armitage and Berry
# 1994, the survival of 374 patients after surgery for a malignancy; the test workbook's
# Survival worksheet columns Year, Died and Withdrawn) in R

# Base R and the survival package have no actuarial life table (survfit() gives the
# Kaplan-Meier estimate, which treats each death time individually), so the Berkson and
# Gage table is computed from its formulae: the number at risk in an interval is reduced
# by half the withdrawals of that interval, and the probability of surviving beyond an
# interval is the product of the interval survival probabilities up to it. The last
# interval is open ended, so its probability of death is not estimated and the table
# stops at the survival to its start (StatsDirect prints * for these cells)

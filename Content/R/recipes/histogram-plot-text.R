# StatsDirect recipe: Histogram (Text), as the help shows it in R.

# sperm deformity index of 116 men whose partners did not conceive; the test
# workbook's Graphics worksheet column "SDI not conceived") in R

# StatsDirect chose nine bins of width 10 with "neat" mid-points 110 to 190, so
# the bin edges are 105, 115, ..., 195. A value equal to a bin's upper limit is
# counted in that bin, which is hist()'s default (right = TRUE), and a value on the
# lowest edge would go into the first bin (include.lowest = TRUE, also the default).

# The text histogram as StatsDirect prints it: the highest bin first, its count at
# the left, then the mid-point and a bar of "=" signs. The bars are on the scale of
# the count ruler drawn beneath them, which ends at a neat value above the largest
# count (35 here, which pretty() also gives; for other data the two may differ),
# and the full width of 60 characters stands for that value

# StatsDirect recipe: Sample size for a paired or single sample t test, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (sample_size/paired_t_test.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# settings: delta = d, sdiff = sd, target = p, alpha = a

# Sample size for a paired t test: the StatsDirect help example (an invented plan for
# a study of peak expiratory flow rate before and after a cold walk, like the paired t
# test example: a fall of 20 L/min to detect, sd of paired differences 35 L/min) in R

# power.t.test solves for the number of pairs at which the power of the two sided
# paired t test, from the non-central t distribution, equals the target. strict = TRUE
# counts rejections in both tails as the report does; the default counts only the tail
# on the side of delta, which seldom changes the whole number of pairs.

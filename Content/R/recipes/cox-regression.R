# R's standard model. The report handles tied event times by Breslow's
# approximation, so ties = "breslow" is given (R's default is Efron's method, which
# gives b = 0.961322 here). The report's z and P are the Wald test of each
# coefficient, its deviance chi-square is R's likelihood ratio test, and its hazard
# ratio and 95% limits are exp(coef) with the lower .95 and upper .95 limits.

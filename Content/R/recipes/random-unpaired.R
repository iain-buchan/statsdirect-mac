# StatsDirect recipe: Random allocation to two independent groups, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (randomization/two_independent_groups.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# settings: n = high, seed = seed

# Random allocation to two independent groups: the StatsDirect help illustration (30
# subjects, 15 to each of an intervention and a control group, seed 10) in R

# StatsDirect shuffles the subject numbers 1 to n with its own Mersenne Twister
# generator, gives the first half to the intervention group and the second half to
# the control group, and lists each group in ascending order. In R, sample(n) draws
# a random permutation of 1 to n, and the groups are taken from it in the same way.
# R's default generator is also a Mersenne Twister, but set.seed() sets its state
# from the seed in R's own way, so for the same seed R draws a different sequence
# from StatsDirect's: the allocation printed here is another valid random
# allocation, not a copy of the one in the help. Any allocation from a stated seed
# can be reproduced by running the same code again with that seed.

# R has no function for this, so the procedure is written out. Round by round (1st
# choices, then 2nd, then 3rd) each group with places left takes the unallocated
# subjects who chose it in that round; when more want it than there are places, a
# random sample of them gets in, so each has the same chance. Subjects still without
# a group after the last round are placed at random in the places left over.
# set.seed() makes an allocation repeatable. R's random number generator is not
# StatsDirect's (both are Mersenne twisters, but seeded and used differently), so the
# same seed gives a different allocation in R from the one in the help.

# The Kaplan-Meier function of the Analysis menu, asked to save its estimates, writes
# ten columns for each group to the worksheet: Time, Death/Event, Survival Proportion
# (S), Approx. SE(S), 95% LCI S, 95% UCI S and the same four for the hazard, with one
# row for each subject in time order. The groups are numbered in the order in which
# they first occur in the group column, so group 1 of the saved columns is Group Surv
# 2 here. survfit gives the same S (the product limit estimate), and with
# conf.type = "log-log" the same limits: the interval is set on log(-log S), as
# recommended by Kalbfleisch and Prentice, so that it stays between 0 and 1. A row
# where S has reached 0 has no limits.

# given for every group, a dashed black line from the lower to the upper limit at each
# death time. The X axis is titled Times and the Y axis Survival proportion, from 0 to
# 1; the chart is titled Survival plot and a legend below it numbers the groups. Base
# R's plot of a survfit object starts the steps at time 0; StatsDirect starts them at

# The exact test is a binomial test on the discordant pairs: under the null
# hypothesis each of the s + t pairs that differ is equally likely to favour
# either medium, so s ~ Binomial(s + t, 1/2). With probability 1/2 the binomial is
# symmetric, so the outcomes at least as far from 7 as s = 12 are 0 to 2 and 12 to 14,
# and binom.test's two sided P (0.0129) is twice the one sided P. mcnemar.test() on the

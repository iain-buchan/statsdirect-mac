# StatsDirect recipe: Wei-Lachin test of survival over repeated periods, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (survival_analysis/wei_lachin.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# data: group = gid, times... = scrapTimes, censor... = scrapCensor

# the times and the censoring of each period, as columns
times <- do.call(cbind, times)
censor <- do.call(cbind, censor)   # 1 = event, 0 = censored
# Wei-Lachin test: the StatsDirect help example (Makuch and Escobar 1991, days for
# lymphocyte cultures from 47 HIV patients in two treatment groups to express p24
# antigen, over four periods) in R. The data are the test workbook's Survival worksheet
# columns Treatment Gp, time m1, censor m1, ... time m4, censor m4.

# One repeat time on its own is an ordinary two-group survival comparison, which the
# survival package (it comes with R) tests with survdiff(): rho = 0 is the log-rank
# test and rho = 1 the Peto-Peto version of the Wilcoxon test. Their chi-squares differ
# from the Wei-Lachin univariate ones below, which weight by the proportion at risk
# (Gehan) and use Wei and Lachin's variance estimate rather than the hypergeometric one

print(survdiff(Surv(times[, 1], censor[, 1]) ~ group))

# Neither base R nor the survival package has the Wei-Lachin test, so it is computed by
# the formulae above, following Makuch and Escobar (1991). For each repeat time and
# each event, e is the expected share of the event for each group (its number at risk
# over the total at risk), weighted by w: 1 for the log-rank method, or the proportion
# of subjects at risk for Gehan's generalised Wilcoxon method. Each subject then has a
# score for each repeat time (its weighted expected share for the other group if it had
# an event, less the running sum psi of the expected shares of the events in its own
# group at or before its own time, each divided by the number of its group then at
# risk), and the covariance matrix of the statistics is the mean cross product of these
# scores

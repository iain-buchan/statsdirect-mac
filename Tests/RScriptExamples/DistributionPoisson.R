# Poisson distribution: the StatsDirect help illustration (probabilities for a count of
# events with a given mean, and the mean that gives a chosen tail probability) in R

# events to 15 decimal places, and a mean to 15 significant figures; these helpers
# print R's values the same way.

# probability). In R they come from the gamma distribution: n or more events with mean

# StatsDirect recipe: McNemar test of a paired 2 by 2 table with its exact probabilities, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (chi_square_tests/mcnemar.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# table: counts
# settings: confidence = gamma
# hand-edited: the confidence level and the data come from the run, as the header says

# McNemar and exact (Liddell) test for matched pairs: the StatsDirect help example
# (Armitage and Berry 1994, p. 127, fifty sputum specimens cultured on two media) in R

# R's standard McNemar test uses only the discordant pairs b and c. Its default,
# correct = TRUE, applies Yates' continuity correction, as the report's second
# chi-square does; correct = FALSE gives the uncorrected chi-square. When b = c, R
# prints 0 for both chi-squares (P = 1).

# (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the proportion b/(b + c)

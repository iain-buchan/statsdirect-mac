# halves run from 0 at the centre to the scale maximum at the edge, and there is no
# axis: the scale maximum is written under the chart. Its default is the largest count
# rounded up to a neat value (the top label of the axis StatsDirect would draw for 0 to
# that count), or the largest count itself when that is greater. The default is 2500
# here, which pretty() also gives. Give pyramids that are to be compared the same

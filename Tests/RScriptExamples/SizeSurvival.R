# Sample size for survival analysis: the StatsDirect help example (an invented trial
# of a new treatment against the usual one: median survival 12 months on the usual
# treatment, 18 months hoped for on the new one, two years of recruitment and one
# more year of follow-up) in R

at <- 24                                  # accrual time, when subjects are recruited
fut <- 12                                 # further follow-up time after recruitment

# Neither base R nor the survival package has a function for this sample size, so the
# topic's formula (Schoenfeld and Richter 1982) is written out here. Survival is taken
# to be exponential in both groups, so the hazard ratio is the inverse ratio of the
# median survival times. A subject recruited at a uniformly distributed time during
# accrual is followed for less than the whole study, and the power of the log-rank test
# depends on how many deaths are seen before the study ends.

# to the data, titles the axes with the column titles and the chart "Scatter plot".

# pair that holds an NA. R's default marker (pch = 1) is the same open circle.

# StatsDirect's option to join the markers with lines (the Line plot) first sorts the
# points by X, so the segments run left to right whatever the row order; in R sort
# the rows the same way before asking for lines with type = "b":
# o <- order(age, -pimax)
# plot(age[o], pimax[o], type = "b", xlab = "Subject's Age (years)",
#      ylab = "PImax (cm H2O)", main = "Line plot")
# A further series goes on the same axes with points(), given a different marker
# (pch) and a legend, as StatsDirect does when more than one series is plotted.

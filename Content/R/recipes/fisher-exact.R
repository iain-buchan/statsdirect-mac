# of every table with the same margins that is no more likely than the observed one are
# added up. R also estimates the odds ratio conditional on the margins, with a
# confidence interval, which the report does not show. For a one sided P use
# alternative = "greater" (upper tail for the top left count) or "less" (lower tail).

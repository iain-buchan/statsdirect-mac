# over the total at risk), weighted by w: 1 for the log-rank method, or the proportion
# of subjects at risk for Gehan's generalised Wilcoxon method. Each subject then has a
# score for each repeat time (its weighted expected share for the other group if it had
# an event, less the running sum psi of the expected shares of the events in its own
# group at or before its own time, each divided by the number of its group then at
# risk), and the covariance matrix of the statistics is the mean cross product of these

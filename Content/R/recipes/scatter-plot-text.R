# StatsDirect recipe: Scatter plot drawn as text, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (graphics/scatter_text.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# data: gain, weight

# Scatter plot (text-based): the StatsDirect help illustration (Armitage and Berry
# 1994, birth weight in oz and percentage weight gain between 70 and 100 days of 32
# babies; the test workbook's Regression worksheet columns "Birth Weight" and
# "% Increase") in R

# StatsDirect draws the plot as text on a grid of characters 85 columns wide: the y
# axis stands in column 15 and the x axis runs 60 columns to its right; there are 5
# lines for every tic of the y axis and 5 more for the titles and the x axis. Each
# point goes to the nearest character cell (a half is rounded to the even neighbour, as
# round() does); a second point in the same cell turns its * into 2, a third into 3
# and so on, and ten or more are marked X. A pair with a missing value is left out.
# The axis scales are chosen automatically; for these data StatsDirect offers 70 to
# 140 in tens and 25 to 125 in 25s (labelled with one decimal place). The scale runs
# from the first to the last tic, stretched to the data where a point lies beyond.

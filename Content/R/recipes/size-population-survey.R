# StatsDirect recipe: Sample size for a population survey, as the help shows it in R.
# From the help's R code (sample_size/population_survey.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# settings: N = ps, p = p, d = xd, conf = cco

# Sample size for a population survey: the StatsDirect help example (an invented
# survey of smoking among the 20,000 adults of a town, expected 25% give or take 3%,
# with 95% confidence) in R

# Base R has no function for this survey sample size, so the topic's formula is used:
# the size for an unlimited population from the normal approximation to the binomial,
# then the finite population correction, then rounding up to a whole number of subjects.
z <- qnorm(1 - (1 - conf) / 2)            # two sided: 1.959964 for 95% confidence
sn <- z^2 * p * (1 - p) / d^2             # for an unlimited population
n <- sn / (1 + sn / N)                    # with the finite population correction
# StatsDirect adds one to the whole part of n instead, so a rate of exactly 0% or 100%
# (n = 0) gives 1 there and 0 here; they differ only when n is a whole number

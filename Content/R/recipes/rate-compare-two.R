# StatsDirect recipe: Two crude rates compared, as the help shows them in R.
# From the help's R code (rates/compare_crude_incidence_rates.htm); the data and settings above come from the run.
# settings: a = a, b = b, pt1 = pt1, pt2 = pt2, confidence = gamma

# Compare two crude rates: the StatsDirect help example (Stampfer et al. 1985, cases of
# coronary heart disease and person-years of follow up among users and non-users of
# postmenopausal hormones) in R

# R's standard comparison of two rates. It conditions on the total number of cases:
# if the two rates were equal, the exposed cases a would be binomial with probability
# pt1 / (pt1 + pt2), so the comparison is the exact binomial test of a in a + b. Its
# rate ratio is the report's rate ratio and its conditional maximum likelihood
# estimate. Its interval is the Clopper-Pearson binomial interval turned into a rate
# ratio, which is the report's exact (Fisher) interval. Its P value is the report's
# two sided exact Fisher P (the binomial test of a in a + b, two sided).
pct <- paste0(100 * confidence, "%")
print(poisson.test(c(a, b), c(pt1, pt2)))

# The rates and their difference. Each rate has the variance of a Poisson count
# divided by the square of its person-time, so the standard error of the difference
# is the square root of a / pt1^2 + b / pt2^2, and the limits are the difference
# plus or minus z times that standard error. The chi-square statistic compares a
# with its expected value given the total number of cases
